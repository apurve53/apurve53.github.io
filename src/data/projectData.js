  "description": "I am holding my bachelor's degree in information technology. I started practicing for software development. Then I started a new job in my desired field. I joined a company where I was a trainee for 6 months then I was promoted to Associate Software Engineer, and I was used to developing Salesforce Applications. After working in the Salesforce CRM development environment, I started developing applications for the web in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Salesforce architecture. And for further improvement in my skills, I started learning new frameworks like express.js for the backend, Electron.js, etc. These days, I am used to writing code in an optimized way by using modules, classes, and different third-party APIs. Although I am a pseudo developer, I have a good knowledge of creating queries to communicate with MongoDB. With my knowledge and expertise, I am able to write complicated business logic. With Node.js, I have hands-on experience in the express framework and MongoDB driver, giving important participation in projects to establish communications between clients and server-side algorithms. I also create algorithms based on the requirements of the functional area of projects. I have some knowledge of different types of databases. I believe this knowledge adds value to businesses. I am always oriented towards making an impact, and I work with a vision."
